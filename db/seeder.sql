It also has the two coin buckets as well. I believe this one is in the original cabinet but the previous owner painted the art work in black but I could be wrong... The art work that is currently on it is just a side art sticker I bought.. it doesn''t have the original cover that goes over the control panel and the control panel art isn''t the original either.. Game loads up fine but does have a buzzing sound when the game loads up / game playing.. This is probably a simple fix.. I''ve owned this one for four years.. They do have signs of  scratches / missing wood due to moving from place to place..  Any other questions just send me a message..',
